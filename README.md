# BookFlix â€” Intelligent Book Management & Recommendation API
BookFlix is a scalable, AI-enhanced backend platform for intelligent book management and semantic recommendations integrated with Groq LLM â€” built with ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL, pgvector. 

## Description

**BookFlix** is a secure, modular, and scalable API-first backend platform built with **ASP.NET Core Web API** and **Entity Framework Core**. It manages books, categories, and ratings with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination, following scalable software design principles. Featuring robust JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization, clean service-repository separation, and scalable dependency injection, all structured within a maintainable and extensible architecture.  

The project includes intelligent, vector-based AI recommendations using pgvector, powered by the Groq LLM API, coupled with advanced semantic similarity search using pgvector in PostgreSQL. A dedicated Python microservice asynchronously generates embeddings, decoupled via a queue-based pipeline to ensure optimal performanceÂ andÂ modularity.

| POST   | /api/auth/login    | Login and receive JWT token        | Public         |

### Roles and Permissions Overview

These define access levels for users to enforce role-based authorization across all API operations. 

| Role    | Permissions                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Admin   | Full access to all endpoints                |
| Writer  | Can manage books (create, update, delete)   |
| Reader  | Can view books, categories, and ratings     |

## Embedding Service Architecture

Embeddings are generated asynchronously via a Python-based microservice integrated into the .NET application.

- When a book is created, its data is queued for embedding generation.
- A hosted background service listens to this queue.
- The Python service uses Groq's LLM to create vector embeddings.
- These embeddings are stored in PostgreSQL via pgvector for future recommendations.

This design ensures that the API remains highly responsive while handling AI workloads efficiently.

---

## AI-Powered Recommendation Engine

BookFlix includes a powerful vector-based recommendation engine that utilizes semantic similarity and LLM-generated embeddings.

- Groq LLM API generates context-aware embeddings from book titles and metadata.
- pgvector is used for high-speed vector similarity search in PostgreSQL.
- EmbeddingQueue handles asynchronous vector processing without blocking API operations.
- A custom RecommendationService retrieves top-matching books based on semantic embeddings.

This allows the system to deliver highly relevant book suggestions with minimal latency.

## Book Listing Features

BookFlix provides dynamic data operations via filterable, sortable, and pageable endpoints.

- Filtering: Filter books by Title or Author.
- Sorting: Sort by Title, Author, or Price.
- Pagination: Customize with pageNumber and pageSize.
- Parameter Validation: Only specific query keys are allowed for safety and predictability.

- Modular Architecture: Follows clean coding practices with separation of controller, service, and repository layers.
- Role-Based Access Control: Ensures only authorized users access specific actions.
- Optimized DTO Usage: Reduces payload size and boosts performance with AutoMapper.
- Logging with Serilog: Logs API activity to both console and persistent storage.
- Scalable Storage: PostgreSQL and SQL Server integration support high data volume and fast access.
